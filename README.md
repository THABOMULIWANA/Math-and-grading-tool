# Math-and-grading-tool
Tool used to find the roots of a quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c) by entering the coefficients a, b, c. Ensure 'a' is not zero and all inputs are valid numbers. And contains a grading tool used to convert score ( 0- 100) to a letter grade.
A single-file web application that solves quadratic equations and converts numeric scores to letter grades.

Features
Quadratic equation solver (ax² + bx + c = 0)
Grade converter (0-100 score to letter grade)
Input validation and error handling
Responsive design

Test Cases
Quadratic Solver:
a=1, b=5, c=6 → Roots: -2, -3
a=1, b=4, c=4 → Root: -2 (repeated)
a=1, b=2, c=5 → Complex roots
Grade Converter:
85-100 → A+
75-84 → A
65-74 → B+
60-64 → B
55-59 → C+
50-54 → C
0-49 → D
